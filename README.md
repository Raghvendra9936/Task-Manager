Assisment :- W3Villa (Task Manager web App)

This is a project that can keep track of your Task.

To run this repository, follow the following steps:

*  Go to the directory where the project has been cloned using: `cd Task-Management`
*  Install `npm package`, `mongodb`.
*  Execute the following command: `npm i`. This will install all the dependencies in a folder known as `node_modules`.
*  Run Mongodb in your localhost at port 27017 using the command: `mongod --dbpath <path of directory where you want to store your database>`

In the index.js file, Please go and change the environment from production to development to run it locally.
I have provided a command which runs the webpack.
Use npm run watcher command in order to generate the bundle.js file. 
then to run the project: just type npm run start in the terminal and you should be good to go.

If everything goes fine, open your web browser and go to the following link: `localhost:3000`

Hope you never miss any event from now on with your own personal `Task-Manager`

for additional queries, please create an issue and comment with as much details as you can.
Feel free to add more features by creating a seperate branch. I would be more than happy to help :)
